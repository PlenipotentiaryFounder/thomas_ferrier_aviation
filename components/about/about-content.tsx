                As a <span className="font-semibold text-primary">Certified Flight Instructor</span> and aviation
                enthusiast, I've dedicated my career to mastering the art and science of flight while helping others
                achieve their aviation dreams.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                My approach combines technical precision with a passion for innovation. Whether I'm in the cockpit
                teaching complex maneuvers or developing new training methodologies, I bring the same commitment to
                excellence and safety.

                Beyond instruction, I'm the founder of <span className="font-semibold">FlyRight.AI</span>, where we're
                developing next-generation tools to enhance pilot training and flight safety through artificial
                intelligence and data analytics.

                My journey in aviation began with a childhood fascination with aircraft and the freedom of flight. That
                passion led me to pursue formal training at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, where I graduated with
                honors in Aeronautical Science.

                "Aviation is not just about operating an aircraftâ€”it's about developing a mindset of precision,
                continuous learning, and respect for the elements. I believe in teaching not just the mechanics of
                flight, but the art of decision-making that keeps pilots safe."
