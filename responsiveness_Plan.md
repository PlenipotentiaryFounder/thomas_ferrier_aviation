# Responsiveness Enhancement Plan

// ... existing code ...
*   [X] **General UI Components (`components/ui/`)**
    *   [X] Buttons (`button.tsx`): Review padding, text size on mobile. (Action: Reviewed general principles. As `button.tsx` is a UI library component, direct edits are avoided. Responsiveness should be ensured by applying utilities at the instance level if needed. Footer icon buttons were already addressed with `min-w/h-10`.)
    *   [X] Cards (`card.tsx`): Ensure content reflows well, images scale, and text is readable. (Action: Reviewed existing usage. Cards are used within responsive grids, images use `next/image` with `fill`, internal text typography is appropriate. No changes needed for the base component; specific content responsiveness will be handled per instance.)
    *   [X] Forms (e.g., `contact/contact-form.tsx`): Inputs, labels, and overall layout on mobile. (Action: Reviewed newsletter form and contact form. Adjusted Name/Email fields in ContactForm to stack on xs screens (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`). Newsletter form layout is already responsive.)
    *   [X] Modals/Dialogs (if any, e.g., `dialog.tsx`, `alert-dialog.tsx`): Responsiveness of overlay and content. (Action: Reviewed Dialog, AlertDialog, Sheet, Popover, etc. from shadcn/ui. They have good built-in responsive behaviors or rely on Radix UI for viewport-aware positioning. No changes needed to base components.)
    *   [X] Navigation Menus (`navigation-menu.tsx`, `dropdown-menu.tsx`): Behavior on smaller screens. (Action: Reviewed DropdownMenu and NavigationMenu from shadcn/ui. They use Radix UI primitives with built-in responsive considerations and viewport awareness. Usage should be responsive.)
    *   [X] Accordions (`accordion.tsx`): Ensure content within accordions is responsive. (Action: Reviewed Accordion from shadcn/ui. Component itself is responsive. Content placed within AccordionContent must be designed to be responsive. Default content text size is `text-sm`.)
*   [X] **Image & Media Handling**
    *   [X] Consistent use of `next/image` with appropriate `sizes` prop or `fill` with aspect ratio. (Action: Homepage components use `next/image` with `fill` well. Replaced raw `<img>` in `components/consulting/case-studies.tsx` with `next/image` and `fill`.)
    *   [X] Ensure `img` tags (if any) are responsive (`max-w-full h-auto`). (Action: Found one instance in `case-studies.tsx` and replaced with `next/image`.)
    *   [X] Embedded videos/iframes are responsive. (Action: `VideoShowcase` component uses `aspect-video` and `w-full h-full` for iframes within a responsive Dialog, which is excellent.)
*   [X] **Specific Page Layouts (Examples)**
    *   [X] `app/gallery/page.tsx` & `components/gallery/`: Image grids, lightboxes, video dialogs. (Action: Reviewed `GalleryHero`, `PhotoGallery`, `VideoShowcase`, `AircraftShowcase`. Made subtitle font size consistent. Ensured image/video handling is responsive. Adjusted 3D viewer controls for better tap targets. Tabs used for navigation within these components are generally fine for current content volume but noted as a potential scaling concern for many items.)
    *   [X] `app/projects/page.tsx` & `components/projects/`: Project listings, detail views. (Action: Reviewed `ProjectsHero`, `FeaturedProjects`, `TechnologyStack`, `ResearchSection`. Standardized subtitle font sizes. Components use responsive grids and appropriate typography.)
    *   [X] `app/logbook/page.tsx` & `components/logbook/`: Data tables, charts. (Action: Reviewed `LogbookHero`, `FlightStats`, `FlightCharts`, `AircraftExperience`, `RecentFlights`. Standardized subtitle font sizes. Charts use `ResponsiveContainer`. Card layouts are responsive.)
    *   [X] `app/certifications/page.tsx` & `components/certifications/`: Timelines, lists. (Action: Reviewed `CertificationsHero`, `CertificationsList`, `EndorsementsSection`, `Timeline`. Standardized subtitle font sizes. Timeline component is well-designed for responsiveness.)
    *   [ ] Other specific pages/components as identified. (e.g., About, Consulting, Contact pages)
*   **UI Buttons:** Reviewed general responsiveness principles for buttons. Specific instances should apply responsive utilities as needed. Footer icon buttons were adjusted for minimum tap target size.
*   **UI Cards:** Reviewed existing card usage. They are placed in responsive grids and internal content (images, text) appears to be handled responsively. Specific card content will be verified as pages/components are reviewed.
*   **UI Forms:** Reviewed newsletter sign-up and contact form. The contact form's Name/Email fields were updated to stack on extra-small screens for better usability.
*   **UI Modals/Dialogs:** Reviewed base components like Dialog, AlertDialog, Sheet, Popover from shadcn/ui. They exhibit good responsive practices or rely on underlying primitives for viewport handling. No changes to base components needed.
*   **UI Navigation Menus:** Reviewed DropdownMenu and NavigationMenu. These components have built-in responsive behaviors via Radix UI. Their responsive usage depends on context.
*   **UI Accordions:** Reviewed Accordion component. It is structurally responsive. Users must ensure the content placed *inside* accordion panels is responsive and consider the default `text-sm` for content styling.
*   **Image Handling:** Replaced a raw `<img>` tag in `components/consulting/case-studies.tsx` with `next/image` for optimization and consistency. Adjusted subtitle in this component for typographic consistency (`text-lg md:text-xl`). Existing `next/image` usages with `fill` in homepage cards are good.
*   **Video Embeds:** The `VideoShowcase` component demonstrates excellent responsive video embedding using `aspect-video` for iframes within a Dialog. Subtitle also adjusted for consistency.
*   **Gallery Page Components:** Reviewed `GalleryHero`, `PhotoGallery`, `VideoShowcase`, and `AircraftShowcase`. Subtitles were standardized. Image, video, and (placeholder) 3D model displays use responsive techniques. Tap targets for 3D viewer controls increased. Tab navigation within these components is okay for current data volume.
*   **Projects Page Components:** Reviewed `ProjectsHero`, `FeaturedProjects`, `TechnologyStack`, and `ResearchSection`. Standardized subtitle font sizes for consistency. Components use responsive grids and appropriate typography for content within cards.
*   **Logbook Page Components:** Reviewed `LogbookHero`, `FlightStats`, `FlightCharts`, `AircraftExperience`, and `RecentFlights`. Standardized subtitle font sizes. Charts use `ResponsiveContainer` for good responsiveness. Card layouts are generally responsive.
*   **Certifications Page Components:** Reviewed `CertificationsHero`, `CertificationsList`, `EndorsementsSection`, and `Timeline`. Standardized subtitle font sizes. The `Timeline` component is particularly well-crafted for responsiveness.
*   [X] **Testing & Refinement (Phase 3 - Iterative)**
